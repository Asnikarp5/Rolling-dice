Rolling Dice Game

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game

## Features


Rolling dice game with two players is a classic game of chance that is easy to learn and fun to play. To begin the game, each player takes turns rolling a single dice, and the player with the highest number goes first. The first player then rolls  dice, and the sum of the numbers rolled determines their score. The second player then takes their turn, and the game continues in this manner.
